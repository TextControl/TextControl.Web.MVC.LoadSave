## Subject of agreement

The subject of this agreement is the software TX Text Control, included resources such as icons, the operating manuals, online help files and all other accompanying material. It will be referred to henceforth as "TX Text Control".

## Grant of license

Text Control GmbH grants the Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, personal and worldwide license to use one copy of TX Text Control in the development of an end-user application, as described in section 3 (below). This license is for a single developer and not for an entire company. If additional programmers wish to use TX Text Control, additional copies must be licensed.

## End user application

An "end user application" is a specific application program that is licensed to a person or firm for business or personal use. The files which are not listed under section 5 must not be included with the end user application. Furthermore, the end user must not be in a position to be able to neither modify the program, nor to create TX Text Control based programs. Likewise, the end user must not be given the TX Text Control serial number.

## Royalties

With the exceptions described under items 4a and 4b, TX Text Control ActiveX, TX Text Control .NET for Windows Forms and TX Text Control .NET for WPF are royalty free. End user applications that have been developed with TX Text Control may be distributed in an unlimited number, without paying any license fees whatsoever.

1. Server-based programs which have been created with TX Text Control .NET Server for ASP.NET or TX Text Control ActiveX Server may only be installed on a single server or virtual machine, but may be accessed by an infinite number of clients. Additional licenses are required when installing TX Text Control on more than one server or virtual machine (per operating system).

2. TX Text Control .NET ships with an application program called TX Text Control Words, which can be used to create Reporting/MailMerge document templates. TX Text Control Words may be distributed royalty-free. A separate license agreement is required, if TX Text Control Words is to be used with products from vendors other than Text Control GmbH.

## Redistributable files

1. For the ActiveX versions of TX Text Control, redistributable components are those files specifically designated as being distributable in the "Distributing your Applications" section of the online help file.  

2. The TX Text Control ActiveX Server version contains an additional command line registration tool for installing TX Text Control on a server. This file is not redistributable.

3. For TX Text Control .NET for Windows Forms, TX Text Control .NET for WPF and TX Text Control .NET Server for ASP.NET, redistributable components are those files specifically designated as being distributable in the "Distributing your Applications".

4. Included resources such as icon images, which are part of the ResourceProvider module or have been extracted, can be redistributed with applications that use a valid TX Text Control license.
